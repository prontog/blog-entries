SOME INTRODUCTORY TEXT

### Why (create a tool)

It makes your CLI apps easier to use.

### How

Extract available options and commands from the app's usage.

#### Design

All of my CLI apps should have a usage section that is printed with the -h/--help option. The usage section should also has some common structure. This way a basic BASH completion can be automatically generated.

1. call the app with -h (or --help) option
2. extract options
3. extract commands



#### Implementation


> Did you know: MENTION SOMETHING COOL I FOUND WHILE WORKING ON THE TOOL
